## Setup
# MyApp_CI-CD
Containing the extended CI/CD pipelines and Dockerized applications developed in Go, Next.js (TypeScript), and WordPress.

MyApp is a multi-technology application consisting of components developed in Go, Next.js (TypeScript), and WordPress.

Components

Go (./go-app/)
main.go: Contains the main Go application code.
Dockerfile: Defines the Docker image for the Go application.

Next.js (./nextjs-app/)

pages/index.js: Example Next.js page.
package.json: Configuration file for Node.js and npm dependencies.
Dockerfile: Docker image definition for the Next.js application.
.eslintrc.js: ESLint configuration file for linting TypeScript code.

WordPress (./wordpress/)

wp-content/: WordPress content directory.
Dockerfile: Docker image definition for the WordPress site.
phpcs.xml: PHP_CodeSniffer configuration file for WordPress coding standards.


Continuous Integration (CI): 
Implement CI workflows for Go, Next.js (TypeScript), and PHP
(WordPress).
● Configure pipelines to trigger on pushes to the respective branches
(e.g., main, feature branches).
● Integrate linting and unit testing for each technology.
● Ensure that the CI pipelines fail if coding standards or tests are not
met.

Continuous deployment (CD)
CD workflows are defined for each component:
An automatic deployment to a staging environment for successful
builds.
Make sure to replace /path/to/wp-content/themes/your-theme with the actual path to your WordPress theme on the staging server and 
also the SSH_PRIVATE_KEY in settings -> secrets and variable section of your repository.

Docker Compose
A Docker Compose file is provided to orchestrate the deployment of all components locally:
docker-compose.yml: Defines services for Go, Next.js, and WordPress, allowing the entire application stack to be deployed locally.

To set up and run the application locally:

Clone this repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run "docker-compose up" to spin up the entire application stack locally.
